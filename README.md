# DuoBloom

## Name: DuoBloom

### Core Concept

A neo-minimalist fitness tracking application designed specifically for couples.

### Goal

To gamify and simplify the process of getting healthy together. Unlike solitary fitness apps, DuoBloom relies on shared accountability. It allows partners to visualize each other's hydration, nutrition streaks, workout logs, and body transformation progress in real-time, fostering a supportive environment ("Vibes") rather than a competitive one.

### Design Language

- **Aesthetic:** "Bento-grid" layouts, rounded corners (`rounded-[32px]`), and a soft, pastel color palette (Lavender primary) mixed with high-contrast slate text.
- **Interaction:** Smooth Framer Motion transitions, context-aware dialogs, and playful micro-interactions (confetti, liquid fills).
- **Theme:** Fully responsive Light and Dark modes.
  - **Dark Mode Palette:**
    - Background: `#0E172A`
    - Widget Background: `#1E293B`

### 7. Internationalization (i18n)

DuoBloom supports multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.

- **Supported Languages:** English (en) and Spanish (es).
- **Default Language:** English (en).
- **Setup:** Uses `expo-localization`, `i18next`, and `react-i18next`.
- **Resource Files:** Located in `/i18n` folder (`en.json` and `es.json`).

### TypeScript errors in VS Code?

If VS Code shows TypeScript errors after opening the project (e.g. `Cannot use JSX`, `esModuleInterop`, or `expo/tsconfig.base not found`), the editor is using its built-in TypeScript instead of the workspace version.

Fix it with a one-time step:

1. Open the Command Palette: `Cmd + Shift + P`
2. Run **"TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version"**
3. Select **"Use Workspace Version"**
4. If errors persist, run **"TypeScript: Restart TS Server"** from the same palette

VS Code remembers this choice going forward.

## Detailed Feature Breakdown

### 1. Authentication & Onboarding

The entry point to the application, designed to feel welcoming and energetic.

- **Login/Signup Toggle:** A smooth, animated switch between creating an account and signing in.
- **Partner Code Integration:** After signup/profile creation, users get assigned a unique code (e.g., ALEX-8392) to link their account with their partner.
- **Visuals:** Decorative, blurred background elements to create depth.

#### Couple Pair flow:

The following steps describe how couples accounts are linked to each other.

1.  Users create an account by filling the sign up form.
2.  After valid form values are provided, user is redirected to “bloom” page.
3.  At “bloom” page, user gets their unique account “bloom” code
4.  Below their unique code, there is an input text where users enters their partner code
5.  Once entered, a “wait screen” is displayed until both users in the couple enter each other's code.
6.  Then, a “confirm bloom” screen is displayed, where each user MUST click enter.

### 2. Tab 1: Dashboard (The Today)

The central command center provides a "Glanceable" view of the couple's daily status.

- **Partner Bar (Sticky Header):** Displays who you are training with (Partner's avatar).
